Svelte App

![wallpaper.jpg](wallpaper.jpg)

Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. Unlike traditional frameworks such as React or Vue, which perform most of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app. When you write a Svelte component, you write it in a .svelte file using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During the build process, Svelte compiles these components into highly efficient imperative code that directly updates the DOM when the state of the app changes.

## Instructions
